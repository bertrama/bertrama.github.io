## Short series: Contest of Champions

I've been working on a project on my personal time that will be the basis for a short series of posts. Here is a brief description of the problem I'm looking at.

I play Contest of Champions on my phone.  My 3-year old really likes watching the game, but phone screens are small, and my thumbs cover the characters.  Solution:  Get it to run on a device with a larger screen, and get it to take input from a game controller. Extra Credit: Make the input easy to do for whole  game overall menu navigation.
