## Contest of Champions: Part 1

I couldn't accomplish what I wanted to do directly on my android device, so I resolved to run  Contest of Champions in a virtual machine on my computer.  I looked around and tried a few different VM images before finally settling on using [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/#!/).

The base images installed by Genymotion doesn't come with Google Play, which is required by Contest of Champions.  I followed the [directions written by Nathan Esquenazi](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki/Genymotion-2.0-Emulators-with-Google-Play-support) to get it running.  Once I had Google Play installed, I used adb to install Contest of Champions from a .apk file I had.  The Play Store said I had an incompatible device.  Needless to say, it was wrong, my device works pretty well.  I had read that more recent versions of Android on a VM had stability problems with Google Play. I used one of the images with Android 4.3.

Now I have a working Android VM on my laptop, and Contest of Champions runs on it.  I can play it in full-screen, and run an hdmi cable to my tv.  That hits my first objective, being able to play on a larger screen.  But using a mouse to play the game is a little frustrating.  I still want to use a game pad to play it. That comes next.
